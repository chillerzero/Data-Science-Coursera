#Function that takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases 
#and calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations 
#where the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is greater than 
#the threshold. The function should return a vector of correlations for the monitors 
#that meet the threshold requirement. If no monitors meet the threshold requirement, 
#then the function should return a numeric vector of length 0
